# Logistic Regression: Death following Heart Failure

The goal of this project is choosing multivariate data, exploring, displaying, and summarising the data, and providing an analysis that investigates at least one research question or feature of interest in the data.

Our chosen research question was: 
- **Which variables create the most efficient model to predict a death event in patients who have experienced heart failure?**

Through this data set we were able to create a logistic regression model that has a 86% prediction accuracy rate of death after heart failure, using only 3 of the 12 available variables, while using AIC and BIC for variable selection and subsequently using PCA to improve the model.
